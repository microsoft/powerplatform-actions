# GitHub Actions for  Power Platform: Hands-on Lab

## Module 1 - Building Basic Model Driven CDS App for Deployment using GitHub Actions

## Lab Scenario 
In this lab you will be creating a basic Model-driven app to use with Module 2 of the lab where you will learn how to automate the application lifecycle management of the app.

1.	Navigate to make.powerapps.com and sign in with your credentials.  Click the environment selector dropdown in the header and select your development environment.

3.	In the side panel that appears, enter a name for the application and click the dropdown for the publisher and click the Add Publisher option
Note: The solution publisher specifies who developed the app. For this reason, you should create a solution publisher name that's meaningful.
Note: The solution publisher specifies who developed the app, so you should always create a solution publisher name that is meaningful. Furthermore, the solution publisher includes a prefix, which helps you distinguish system components or components introduced by others and is also a mechanism to help avoid naming collisions. This allows for solutions from different publishers to be installed in an environment with minimal conflicts.

4.	A new window will pop up.  If a window does not pop up, check your popup blocker settings.  For the purposes of this lab, enter your ALMLab for the display name, name, and prefix and click Save and Close.

9.	Once your entity is created, click the solution name again to go back to the solution view to add another component

10.	Click the New dropdown, then App, and Model-driven app

14.	Select the Entity dropdown and select your custom entity to add to the sitemap

![Add entity](media/gh-lab-1.140.png "Add entity")

15.	Click Save, then Publish, then Save and Close to go back to the application designer

![Save sitemap](media/gh-lab-1.150.png "Save sitemap")

16.	Click Save then Validate to validate the application

![Save and validate](media/gh-lab-1.160.png "Save and validate")

17.	You should see one warning.  View the warning, then click Publish then Play

![View warning and play](media/gh-lab-1.170.png "View warning and play")

18.	This will take you to the application so that you can see how it looks.  You can use the application and close the tab when you are satisfied.
